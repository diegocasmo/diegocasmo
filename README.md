## Hi, I'm Diego 👋

Architecting software focused on craftsmanship and simple, thoughtful products. At [Buffer](https://buffer.com/), I work with a fully remote team building tools that help creators and small businesses plan, publish, and analyze their social media so they can grow and connect with their communities.

### Projects
